# 8XP File Structure Documentation

The documentation on TI-BASIC bytecode (8XP) files and how they're created/parsed is very little to none, so I figured I'd create a comprehensive documentation here for anyone in the future looking to do this.

## Character Encoding
Whenever text is used in the file, for example, writing out a program name or comment within the file header, it's encoded with standard ASCII. So, if the name of the program is `TEST`, the respective ASCII will be `0x84 0x69 0x83 0x84`

## Data Portion
Some entries in the table will mention the "Data Portion" of the 8XP file. This is the portion of the bytecode which actually contains the instructions. The data portion starts after the header (74 bytes long) and ends before the footer (last 2 bytes). The length of the data portion is just the number of bytes within it.

## Storing Integers
Since many integers are greater than 255 (the max integer that can be contained within one byte), the 8XP format stores them as two bytes. The first byte in the sequence is the size byte, and the second byte is the carry byte. For example, 257 would be stored as (in decimal) `2 1`. We multiply the carry byte by 255 and then add the sum byte to get the total, in this case being 2+255. Storing numbers less than 256 works the same way, with the carry byte just being 0. For example, 85 would be `85 0`. If the integer is big enough for the carry byte to go over 255, the carry byte should just overflow to 0. As an example implementation, here is my Rust implementation for converting base-10 integers to this format:

```rs
pub fn int_to_bytes(size: usize) -> [u8; 2] {
    let mut bytes: [u8; 2] = [0; 2];

    // size byte
    bytes[0] = (size & 0xFF) as u8;
    // carry byte
    bytes[1] = ((size >> 8) & 0xFF) as u8;

    bytes
}
```

## File Header

The first part of an 8XP file, obviously, is the header. This section contains metadata about the program. I've chosen to organize the bytes into a table and group them by byte-range, so that you can skip to any particular range that you're not sure about and use it as a reference.

| Byte Range | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Example (Decimal)                                                                                                                           | Example (Hex)                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ASCII Equivalent (if applicable)      |

## File Footer (checksum)
The last 2 bytes in an 8XP file are the checksum of the file. This checksum is very simple if you read these directions carefully. Take the second half of the header, starting at the 56th byte (55 if zero-indexed, like in an array. These are the two unknown bytes, `0xD` and `0x0`), and sum up all of the byte values. Then, sum up the byte values of the data portion of the program. Now, add these two numbers together, and convert them into the integer [carry format](#storing-integers).

### Example
Let's pretend that the header starting at byte 56 is as follows:
```asm
0x0D 0x00 0x18 0x02 0x05 0x54 0x45 0x53 0x54 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x16 0x02 0x14 0x02
```

Summing up all of these values, we get 410. Next, we need to sum up the data portion of the program. Let's use this as an example:

```asm
0xE1 0x3F 0xDC 0x2A 0x57 0x45 0x49 0x47 0x48 0x54 0x29 0x2A 0x2B 0x57 0x3F 0xDE 0x57
```

Summing up all of these values, we get 1591. If we add this to the header sum of 410, we get 2001. To find the value in the carry format, we can use `2001 & 0xFF` to get the size byte (209) and `(2001 >> 8) & 0xFF` to get the carry byte (7). Therefore, the checksum would be `209 7` in decimal or `0xD1 0x07` in hex.
