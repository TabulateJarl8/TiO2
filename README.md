# TiO2

TiO2 an interpreter, compiler, and decompiler for TI-BASIC programs. It is the successor to [ti842py](https://github.com/TabulateJarl8/ti842py), which is a TI-BASIC to Python transpiler.

# Features

 - Interpretation: You can run TI-BASIC programs as .8XP files. This is useful for testing or running programs directly.

 - Decompilation: This tool can decompile .8XP files, allowing you to see the TI-BASIC code in a human-readable format. You can specify an output file for the decompiled code, or it can be printed to the console.

 - Compilation: If you have TI-BASIC code in a text format, you can compile it into a .8XP file, which will allow you to then run it with TiO2 or transfer it to your calculator to run.
